# Heathrow to London

## Graphic addition to a simple graph problem, written in Haskell. Done as a project for 'Functional Programming' course at Belgrade's University, Faculty of Mathematics. 

Problem is based on a Heathrow to London problem, defined and described in [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) book. On top of the standard solution this project contains animated visual representation, with use of `gloss` and `gloss-game` packages for Haskell programming language.
